# **VexillologyBot**: Flag finder for flag fans.
VexillologyBot is a bot designed for the [r/vexillology](https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/) subreddit.

## What does he do?

u/VexillologyBot is designed to link SVG images of all flags mentioned in the title of r/vexillology submissions.

## Why?

Many people who browse r/vexillology are NOT flag experts. We enjoy the artwork being created, but we are unable to apreciate the finer details since we don't have the worlds flags memorized.

For example, lets take the post: **"Portugal in the style of Barbados"**

The post will be best understood if the viewer intimately knows the flags in question. Knowing the flags of Barbados and Portugal allows the viewe to apreciate how the OP used color and which symbolism comes from which flag.

For this reason, I created u/VexillologyBot.

He will link high-quality SVG versions of all found-flags he finds. The hope is that normies like myself who browse vexillology (especialy those on mobile) will then be able to click on those images and increase our flag-knowledge and enjoyment.

## What flags does he know?
Currently, he knows knows all country flags by name, and a smattering of other flags.

Examples:
 * American
 * United States
 * Spain
 * Barbados
 * Union Jack
 * Antarctica

## The future:
In the future, I will teach how him to recognize state flags, city flags, and anything else I figure out how to easily add. My MAIN goal for this bot is to **keep him usefull without being annoying**.
