# **VexillologyBot**: Flag finder for flag fans.
VexillologyBot is a bot designed for the [r/vexillology](https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/) subreddit.

## What does he do?

u/VexillologyBot is designed to link PNG images of all flags mentioned in the title of r/vexillology submissions.

## Why?

Many people who browse r/vexillology are NOT flag experts. We enjoy the artwork being created, but we are unable to apreciate the finer details since we don't have the worlds flags memorized.

For example, lets take the post: **"Portugal in the style of Barbados"**

The post will be best understood if the viewer intimately knows the flags in question. Knowing the flags of Barbados and Portugal allows the viewer to apreciate how the OP used color and which symbolism comes from which flag.

For this reason, I created [u/VexillologyBot](https://www.reddit.com/user/vexillologyBot).

He will link high-quality PNG versions of all flags mentioned in the title of each submission. The hope is that individuals like myself who browse vexillology (especialy those on mobile) will then be able to click on those images and increase our flag-knowledge and enjoyment.

## What flags does he know?
Currently, he knows knows all country flags, all US and German state flags, and a smattering of others. This system is built with a robust aliasing system, which means many keywords will trigger the same flag.

Examples:
 * American
 * United States
 * Spain
 * Barbados
 * New York
 * Union Jack
 * Antarctica

## The future:
In the future, I will teach him to respond to comments as well as posts.
